 Summary of useState:- 
 -> With the useState hook, the state doesn't have to be an Object
 -> The useState hook returns an array with 2 Elements.
    The first One is the current value of the state, the second Elements is the state setter function
 -> When dealing with Objects and array, always make sure to use to spread (...) your state variable and then call setter function

 useEffect:- 
 It is a close replacement of componentDidMount() , componentWillMount(), componentDidUpdate()
 -> useEffect runs after every render of components

 It run every single time when something is rendered So to avoid it we provide conditioning in useEffect by passing 2nd argument
 We pass the variable in a array So when this variable gets changed than it renders.
